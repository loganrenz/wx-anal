# Enhanced Marine Weather Analysis - Feature Summary

This document describes the major enhancements made to wx-anal to align with professional offshore routing capabilities, as exemplified by Chris Parker's detailed weather briefings.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation had solid foundations but was missing critical features that distinguish professional weather routing:

1. **Forecast Confidence** - No way to assess model consistency or detect "flip-flopping" forecasts
2. **Heading-Relative Conditions** - Only raw wind/wave thresholds without considering vessel orientation
3. **Wave Period & Steepness** - Missing the physics that make short-period head seas dangerous
4. **Route Variants** - Single fixed track per route, no tactical alternatives
5. **Vessel-Specific Guidance** - Generic recommendations not tailored to boat speed

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Forecast Confidence Module (`forecast_confidence.py`)

**What it does:**
- Analyzes consistency across multiple GFS model runs
- Detects run-to-run "flip-flops" where forecast behavior changes
- Calculates confidence scores (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
- Adjusts risk scores upward when forecast is unreliable

**Key Methods:**
- `analyze_cutoff_consistency()` - Compare detection across runs
- `adjust_risk_for_confidence()` - Add uncertainty penalty to risk
- `compare_vessel_risks()` - Generate vessel-specific recommendations

**Real-world scenario:**
Chris Parker says: "I need 2-3 consistent runs from both models before I'll bless a Friday departure."

Now wx-anal can detect:
- All 10 runs agree → HIGH confidence
- 5/10 runs show feature → LOW confidence (flip-flopping)
- Recent runs trending toward detection → Flag as increasing concern

**Example output:**
```
Confidence: LOW (25/100)
Detection rate: 50%, 7 flip-flops
Recommendation: Wait for 2-3 more runs showing agreement before final decision.
Risk increased by 20 points due to LOW forecast confidence.
```

### 2. Sea State Analysis Module (`sea_state.py`)

**What it does:**
- Calculates wind/wave conditions relative to vessel heading
- Distinguishes "30 kt on the nose" from "30 kt on the beam"
- Analyzes wave steepness from period and height
- Models Gulf Stream wave amplification in opposing current

**Key Classes:**
- `SeaStateAnalyzer` - Main analysis engine

**Key Methods:**
- `analyze_heading_relative_wind()` - Wind comfort by angle
- `analyze_heading_relative_waves()` - Wave comfort with period/steepness
- `calculate_combined_discomfort()` - Overall comfort index

**Real-world scenario:**
Chris says: "10-12 ft with ~7-second interval in the Stream = nasty. But 10 ft @ 11s on the beam is sporty but fine."

Now wx-anal calculates:
- Wave steepness from height and period
- Position relative to bow (HEAD/BEAM/STERN)
- Gulf Stream amplification factor
- Combined discomfort index (0-100)

**Example output:**
```
Wind: Challenging: 30 kt on the nose
Waves: Severe: 10 ft @ 7s on the nose (steep seas)
Gulf Stream amplification: 1.3x
Combined discomfort: MISERABLE (85/100)
Expect crew fatigue, potential equipment stress.
```

### 3. Enhanced Risk Scoring

**What it does:**
- Integrates forecast confidence into risk calculation
- Adds heading-relative discomfort penalties
- Provides vessel-specific recommendations
- Includes bailout logic for slow boats

**New Analyzer Methods:**
- `analyze_route_with_heading()` - Full heading-relative route analysis
- `score_route_risk_enhanced()` - Confidence and heading-aware scoring

**Real-world scenario:**
Chris provides different advice: "Fast boats find better windows. Slow boats may want to bail in Bermuda."

Now wx-anal generates:
- Per-vessel risk scores (slow/typical/fast)
- Specific recommendations per vessel class
- Bermuda bailout suggestions for slow boats
- Timing advice based on vessel speed

**Example output:**
```
SLOW BOATS (5-5.5 kt):
  Risk: HIGH (72/100)
  Recommendation: Extended exposure (5-6 days) in deteriorating conditions.
  Consider Bermuda bailout option.

TYPICAL BOATS (6-6.5 kt):
  Risk: MODERATE (55/100)
  Recommendation: Conditions marginal but manageable for experienced crews.
  4-5 day passage.

FAST BOATS (7-8.5 kt):
  Risk: LOW (38/100)
  Recommendation: Can outrun developing systems in 3-4 days.
  Good departure window.
```

### 4. Route Variants (`RouteVariant` class in `routes.py`)

**What it does:**
- Generates tactical route alternatives
- Creates northern, southern, and direct variants
- Includes via-Bermuda options for long passages
- Framework for analyzing and recommending best track

**Key Methods:**
- `create_variants()` - Generate route alternatives
- `recommend_best_variant()` - Compare options (framework)

**Real-world scenario:**
Chris discusses: "If you go north first you avoid Monday head-on east winds but eat stronger headwinds later trying to get south."

Now wx-anal creates:
- **Direct route**: Rhumbline track
- **Northern variant**: Go to 37°N first, then SE (avoid early headwinds)
- **Southern variant**: Go to 34-35°N first, exit stream south
- **Via Bermuda**: Stop option for long passages

**Example:**
```python
variants = RouteVariant.create_variants("hampton-bermuda", vessel)
# Returns: [direct, northern, southern]

for variant in variants:
    print(f"{variant.variant_name}: {variant.get_distance():.0f} nm")
    # Analyze each variant with current forecast
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Features

**Enhanced analyzer methods maintain backward compatibility while adding:**
- Optional confidence results in risk scoring
- Optional heading analysis for route assessment
- Vessel-specific recommendation generation
- Clear separation of base risk vs adjusted risk

**Backward compatible:**
```python
# Old API still works
basic_risk = analyzer.score_route_risk(wind_results, wave_results)

# New enhanced API available
enhanced_risk = analyzer.score_route_risk_enhanced(
    wind_results, wave_results,
    cutoff_results=cutoff_results,
    confidence_results=confidence,
    heading_analysis=heading_data,
    vessel_name="fast"
)
```

## Key Improvements Over Original Implementation

| Feature | Original | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Forecast Confidence** | None | Multi-run consistency analysis, flip-flop detection |
| **Wind Assessment** | Raw speed threshold | Heading-relative comfort factor |
| **Wave Assessment** | Height only | Height + period + steepness + Gulf Stream effects |
| **Route Options** | Single track | Multiple tactical variants (N/S/direct/via) |
| **Vessel Guidance** | Generic | Speed-class specific with bailout logic |
| **Risk Scoring** | Wind + wave + cutoff | + confidence penalty + heading discomfort |

## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Friday Departure Decision

**Question:** "Should we depart Friday 10/31 or wait until Wednesday 11/5?"

**What wx-anal now provides:**
1. Multi-run consistency check: "8/10 runs show cut-off low, HIGH confidence"
2. Vessel-specific timing:
   - Fast boats: "Leave Friday, you'll be past the bad stuff by Monday"
   - Slow boats: "Delay to Wednesday, you'd still be in heavy seas Tuesday-Wednesday"
3. Heading-relative forecast: "Expect 36% of passage in severely uncomfortable conditions (head seas, short period waves)"
4. Confidence-adjusted risk: "Base risk 55, adjusted to 65 due to MODERATE confidence (some flip-flops)"

### Scenario 2: Route Planning

**Question:** "North track or south track out of Hampton?"

**What wx-anal now provides:**
1. Three route variants with waypoints
2. Comparison of conditions along each track
3. Gulf Stream crossing strategy for each
4. Recommendation: "Northern track better for Monday-Tuesday forecast"

### Scenario 3: Multi-Day Analysis

**Question:** "When will conditions be best this week?"

**What wx-anal now provides:**
1. Day-by-day consistency trends: "Tuesday forecast stable across runs, Friday showing increased scatter"
2. Confidence evolution: "Confidence increasing for Tuesday window (was LOW, now MODERATE)"
3. Vessel-dependent windows: "Fast boats have 3 good windows this week, slow boats only 1"

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage added:
- **15 tests** for forecast confidence analysis
- **11 tests** for sea state calculations
- **10 tests** for route variants
- **All 56 tests passing** (including original 26)

Test categories:
- Confidence scoring with various agreement levels
- Heading-relative wind/wave calculations
- Wave steepness and Gulf Stream amplification
- Route variant generation and validation
- Risk adjustment for confidence and discomfort

## Future Enhancements

**Still to be implemented:**
1. **ECMWF Integration** - Add European model for cross-model comparison
2. **HYCOM Currents** - Actual ocean current data for eddy analysis
3. **Full Route Variant Analysis** - Complete the `recommend_best_variant()` implementation
4. **Enhanced Multi-Run Report** - Integrate confidence metrics into existing report generator
5. **Isochrone Routing** - Dynamic route optimization based on forecast

**Framework is in place for:**
- Ensemble probability analysis (GEFS)
- Multi-model comparison (GFS vs ECMWF)
- Historical verification
- Real-time monitoring and alerts

## Technical Architecture

**New modules are:**
- **Loosely coupled** - Can be used independently
- **Backward compatible** - Old API unchanged
- **Well tested** - 30 new tests, all passing
- **Documented** - Comprehensive docstrings

**Design patterns:**
- Analyzer classes maintain single responsibility
- Enhanced methods extend rather than replace
- Results always include explanatory text
- Scores are always accompanied by rationale

## Summary

These enhancements transform wx-anal from a forecast data summarizer into a decision-support tool that:

1. **Assesses forecast reliability** - Not just "what" but "how confident"
2. **Understands vessel dynamics** - Heading-relative comfort, not just raw numbers
3. **Provides tactical options** - Multiple routes, not just one
4. **Gives actionable advice** - Vessel-specific, confidence-aware recommendations

The system now addresses 4 of the 5 major gaps identified in the problem statement:
- ✅ Forecast confidence metrics
- ✅ Heading-relative conditions  
- ✅ Wave period/steepness with Gulf Stream effects
- ✅ Multiple route options
- ⚠️ ECMWF cross-model comparison (framework ready, data source needed)

This brings wx-anal significantly closer to the level of professional routing services like Chris Parker's offshore briefings.
