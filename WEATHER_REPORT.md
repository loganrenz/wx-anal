## Weather Feature Detection

### Chris Parker's Forecast Scenario Analysis

**Reference:** Marine weather briefing for Hampton → Bermuda/Antigua departures

**Key Forecast Question:**
>  *Will an upper-level low get cut off from the main flow over Louisiana on Sunday 11/2,*
>  *and if so, will it reattach to the progressive upper-level flow and shift off the US East Coast,*
>  *creating nasty weather throughout the southwest North Atlantic around Tuesday-Wednesday (11/3-11/5)?*

### Cut-off Low Analysis (Louisiana Region)

**Target Area:** 25-34°N, 88-96°W (Louisiana and vicinity)

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-29 12:00 UTC

🟢 **NO CUT-OFF LOW DETECTED - GOOD CASE VERIFIED**

**Analysis Results:**
- No significant vorticity maxima detected over Louisiana region
- 500 hPa vorticity remains below detection threshold (8×10⁻⁵ s⁻¹)
- Pattern does not match Chris Parker's 'bad case' scenario
- Conditions appear stable through forecast period

**Recommendation:**
> 🟢 **FRIDAY 10/31 DEPARTURE LOOKS FAVORABLE** based on current analysis.
> The feared cut-off low scenario is NOT verifying in this model run.
> Conditions suggest a stable pattern with no major system development
> threatening the offshore waters Monday-Wednesday (11/3-11/5).
> 
> However, continue to monitor subsequent model runs. The absence of
> the cut-off low in this run is good news, but verify consistency
> across multiple runs before making final departure decision.

## Route Conditions: Hampton → Bermuda

### Wind Conditions

- **Maximum Wind:** 0.0 m/s (0 kt)
- **Average Wind:** 0.0 m/s (0 kt)
- **Time Above 30 kt:** 0.0%

## Risk Assessment


---

## Gulf Stream Crossing Strategy

**Recommended Crossing Latitude:** 37.0°N
**Recommended Exit Latitude:** 36.5°N

**Rationale:**

- Moderate conditions - can cross at or near departure latitude

**Additional Considerations:**

- Monitor sea surface currents for eddy positions
- Stay south of counterclockwise eddies
- Stay north of clockwise eddies
- Potential 1-2 kt current benefit with optimal routing

---

## Summary

### Key Points

1. ✓ **No significant cut-off low** detected at this time
2. ✓ **Moderate wind conditions** generally favorable

### Vessel-Specific Guidance

**Slow Boats (5-5.5 kt):**
- Plan for 5+ day passage to Bermuda
- Consider stopping in Bermuda if continuing to Caribbean
- Most vulnerable to weather windows

**Typical Boats (6-6.5 kt):**
- Plan for 4-5 day passage to Bermuda
- Can likely continue to Caribbean with favorable forecast
- Good balance of speed and comfort

**Fast Boats (7-8.5 kt):**
- Plan for 3-4 day passage to Bermuda
- Maximum weather window flexibility
- Can outrun or avoid most systems
